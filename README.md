We first read over the specifications of the assignment paying close attention to details. Then we made a UML diagram detailing the classes and methods and the interactions between them. We will insert a photo here.

Then we split up the functionality into tasks.

yoonsik: terminal reader
Andreea: Menu Loader

We started with pair programming the TerminaLReader, where Yoonsik acted as the driver and Andreea acted as the navigator.
In TerminalReader, we implemented most of the command line functionalities, i.e. the front-end.
We finished most of TerminalReader, taking a break once we hit a roadblock and started rethinking our method of storing Toppings.
At this point, we decided it was a good time to take a break from that particular problem, and we switched gears to
start working on the Menu Loader, where Andreea was the driver and Yoonsik was the navigator.
We implemented this functionality very efficiently and then went back to TerminalReader. We finished TerminalReader and
concluded our first pair programming sprint.
For both iterations of pair programming, we had a clear idea in our minds about how to implement the data structures and
functionality, and started coding.
Pair programming worked very well for us, as we are both around a similar technique technique level, neither of us being
extremely advanced at coding and code design. We were able to learn many new techniques together and practice using them.
We also were able to offer each other constructive advice and teach each other new things.
